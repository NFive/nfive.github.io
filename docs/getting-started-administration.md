The [NFive Plugin Manager](nfpm/overview.md) makes it easy to administrate your server, see the plugin manager [command reference](nfpm/command-reference.md) for more examples.

## Starting the Server

To start the server:

1. From a terminal in your server directory run the command `nfpm start`.

   You should see the FiveM server start and be able to connect to the server from your FiveM client by using the "Direct Connect" tab and entering your IP address or `localhost`.

If the server started correctly and you are able to connect, then you are finished and the server is setup! If there are any server or client errors then check the next page [Troubleshooting](getting-started-troubleshooting.md) or [how to get help](/help).
