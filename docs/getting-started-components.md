NFive is modular by design and comes in multiple components:

## NFive (Required)

The NFive runtime is a [FiveM server resource](https://docs.fivem.net/scripting-manual/introduction/introduction-to-resources/) which handles loading the installed plugins, database management, communication and events.

## MySQL Database (Required)

NFive makes use of a MySQL database for storing information and game state. See [Database Setup](database) for details.

## Plugin Manager (Recommended)

The NFive Plugin Manager (`nfpm`) is a standalone tool for NFive server administration and management as well as plugin development. See [Plugin Manager](nfpm/overview) for details.
