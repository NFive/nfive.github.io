## Getting Started

The easiest way to start developing a plugin is to use [nfpm](nfpm/nfpm) tool.
It features a command called `scaffold` that can generate a boilerplate containing plugin source code. For more info check the [plugin commands](nfpm/commands-plugins)

1. To start you want to run the scaffold command included in nfpm

    ```shell
    nfpm scaffold
    ```

2. Follow the prompts till it generates a folder called `plugin-<name>`
3. Open the generated project in Visual Studio and start developing your NFive Plugin
